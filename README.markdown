### Convert any image into a base64 string

By using the [Data URI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) scheme you can embed images directly into your HTML and
CSS. It works by encoding an image into a base64 string and place it directly
withing an HTML image tag or as a CSS background URL.
