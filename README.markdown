## Basejump
### Convert any image into a base64 string

By using the [Data URI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) scheme you can embed images directly into your HTML and CSS. It will by default spit out just the encoded image, but you can easily wrap it in an HTML image tag or print it as the url for a CSS background declaration by using the *'-o'* parameter followed by either 'img' or 'css'.
